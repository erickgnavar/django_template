# Simple django template

A simple django template, it uses `cookiecutter` to generate the project and it includes the following:

- Poetry for python depedencies management
- Celery basic config
- Gitlab CI configuration
- Docker and docker-compose configuration
- Bootstrap 4 and jquery. Yeah, they're still relevant and also I said "simple" remember?
- Fontawesome 5

## Usage

Run the following command and that's it :)

```shell
cookiecutter gh:erickgnavar/django_template
```

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
